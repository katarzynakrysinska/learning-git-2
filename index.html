    <div class="chorus">
      <p>Carry on, my wayward son</p>
      <p>There'll be peace when you are done</p>
      <p>Lay your weary head to rest</p>
      <p>Don't you cry no more</p>

    <div class="first">
      <p>Once I rose above the noise and confusion</p>
      <p>Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion</p>
      <p>I was soaring ever higher</p>
      <p>But I flew too high</p>
      <p>Though my eyes could see, I still was a blind man</p>
      <p>Though my mind could think, I still was a mad man</p>
      <p>I hear the voices when I'm dreaming</p>
      <p>I can hear them say</p>
    </div>
    <div class="chorus">
      <p>Carry on, my wayward son</p>
      <p>There'll be peace when you are done</p>
      <p>Lay your weary head to rest</p>
      <p>Don't you cry no more</p>
    </div>
    <div class="second">
      <p>Masquerading as a man with a reason</p>
      <p>My charade is the event of the season</p>
      <p>And if I claim to be a wise man, well</p>
      <p>It surely means that I don't know</p>
      <p>On a stormy sea of moving emotion</p>
      <p>Tossed about, I'm like a ship on the ocean</p>
      <p>I set a course for winds of fortune</p>
      <p>But I hear the voices say</p>
